This work shows a plan for error state determination, diagnosis, and mitigation
using autonomic computing tools and tecniques on the Hubo robot. An
$n$-dimensional geometric enclosure is constructed from periodic measurements
of the robot's normal operating state. Similar hulls will be constructed for
unique faults encountered during runtime. A mapping of these faults to
applicable mitigations will be dynamically constructed and will aid in
mitigation selection. The successful application of the mitigation will bring
the robot back to a safe operating state.

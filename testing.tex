\subsection{Faults}
The states that we will be analyzing for the creation of the convex hull 
for the fault detection mapping fall into four categories, faults, status, 
low level feedback, high level feedback.  A list of the 

\begin{table*}[t]
\caption{-  Metrics analyzed for convex hull creation}\label{table:states}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|l|}\hline
 Metric   &   Type   &   Status/Measurement \\\hline\hline


 Over Current 								& Fault 							& Status flag - motor controller has been shutdown due to over current				\\\hline
 Actuator Status							& Status							&	Status flag - motor controller's internal PID control loop is activated 		\\\hline
 Actuator Zeroed 							& Status							& Status flag - motor controller has been zeroed			 												\\\hline
 Actuator Responding 					&	Status							&	Response - Responds if the motor controller is communicating properly 			\\\hline
 Actuator Commanded Position 	&	Low Level						& Reference position given to motor controller.																\\\hline
 Actuator Measured Position 	& Low Level						& Actual position of motor 																										\\\hline
 Actuator Position Error			& High Level					& Position error between commanded and measured position of the actuator			\\\hline
 Actuator Current							& Low Level						& Current used by the given actuator 																					\\\hline
 Orientation (CG)							& Low Level						& Orientation in 3-DOF given by the IMU																				\\\hline
 Force Torque (feet)					& Low Level						& Force-torque measurement in X,Y, and Z directions on each ankle							\\\hline
 Force Torque (hands)					& Low Level						& Force-torque measurement in X,Y, and Z directions on each wrist							\\\hline
 Orientation (feet)						& Low Level						& 2-DOF orientation (X,Y) of each of the feet 																\\\hline
 ZMP Location									& High Level					& Current ZMP location in (X,Y,Z)																							\\\hline

\subsection{Fault Injection}
Known mechanical, electrical, and communications faults are injected into the Hubo system.  
All states are recorded during each test.  The system is recorded at a rate of 100hz.  A known
stable state is held for the first 30 seconds of recording for a baseline.  At 30 seconds


Faults will be injected into the system for each

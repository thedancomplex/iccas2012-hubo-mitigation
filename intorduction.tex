\section{Introduction}
Electro-mechanical systems eneviatiaibly fail during use.  Failors during opperation typically cause system haults.  This is particuralaly hazerdous to robots that require feedback to ballance such as biped humanoid robots.  For biped humanoids these errors typically include, but are not limited to, actuator failure due to over torque, loss of zero-moment-point\cite{

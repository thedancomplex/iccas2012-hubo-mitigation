\section{Introduction}
Electro-mechanical systems eneviatiaibly fail during use.  Failors during opperation typically cause system haults.  This is particuralaly hazerdous to robots that require feedback to ballance such as biped humanoid robots.  For biped humanoids these errors typically include, but are not limited to, actuator failure due to over torque or loss of zero-moment-point (ZMP) \cite{zmp35} causing a robot fall or colapse.  This is exceptionally harmful to adult size humanoid robots due to their weight.  This paper focuses on way of automatically detecting when a failure is about to occure and choosing the proper mitigation technique. 

Current methods of mitigation of ZMP loss for biped humanoids been invistigated by Kiyoshi Fujiwara et al. \cite{4115653,1248925}.  These methods involve finding an optiomal falling trajectory that reduces the instanous force of the robot at impact by creating multiple impact stages\cite{4399327}.  This method was fully tested on an HRP-2FX (HRP-2P surragate) and partiailly on an HRP-2P.
